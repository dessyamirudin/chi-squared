Chi-Squared Distribution

Chi-squared distribution used for comparing two distribution. It is build by summing n-normal-distribution squared.
How does comparing two distribution using Chi-Squared works?
  a. Divide the two distribution into several segment with the same rule (bound)
  b. See the difference in each of segment. Difference = (O-E)2/E (normalised)
  c. Point (b) should follow normal distribution squared (which is the Chi Squared distribution)
  d. Degree of freedom is the number of segment-1
  e. End
